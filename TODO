1. Add an MCTS mode for passively exploring the tree in the background.
   The interface is straightforward: 
    1. A WebWorker/Thread that runs MCTS, stopping at a certain transposition table size
      (side note: this task would have to invoke prune_ancestors() on board state changes)
    2. A callback that changes the board state and raises a semaphore to signal it has done so.

   Probably should restore parallel_mcts() as a separate function too.
